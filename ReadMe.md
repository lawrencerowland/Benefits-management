 How we operate effective benefits realisation processes, with evidence at each stage
Benefits management is critical because without careful consideration Programmes often deliver scope but don’t realise actual benefits. Our approach supports the delivery of benefits in four stages:
1.	Identify the benefits at the portfolio and programme level
2.	Mapping expected benefits to scope
3.	Controlling the delivery of expected benefits via oversight of portfolio and programme delivery
4.	Realising the benefits in close working with the business and stakeholder groups.
We describe the stage and provide evidence of managing each stage below.
1. Identifying the benefits is carried out as part of the portfolio investment cycle or programme start up and benefits are captured within the programme business case.  The business case is often based on the HM Treasury 5 case approach and has a strategic section that sets out the benefit gained for the investment required in the programme. All of the strategic outcomes intended for the programme will be in some way closely linked to reaching particular benefit(s), or to minimising particular dis-benefits.
agree clear benefits management roles and responsibilities and governance of benefits management 
Identify the functions and stakeholders involved, gather information. Understand and agree required outcomes and Identify strategic drivers 
Identify, define and agree benefits - document the benefits in the business case
Apply lessons learned from previous projects.


2. Mapping Benefits to Scope. To ensure that benefits claimed are achievable, each programme in the portfolio is reviewed to ensure that the scope of their tranches of projects will aggregate to the benefit desired.  Scope is reviewed to ensure that it is both necessary and sufficient; typically Pcubed would use a benefits dependency network tool to do this. Activities include:
Identify and model enablers and benefits critical to the realisation process
Assess the enablers, benefits / negative benefits and outcomes (end benefits) and their linkages
Agree how benefits will be quantified and measured (KPIs)
Define measurement techniques to be used for expected benefits.

3. Controlling the delivery of expected benefits via oversight of portfolio and programme delivery. This is completed by maintaining oversight of programme and project delivery and tracing the benefits through the dependency maps prepared in Stage 2 above.  Without mapping it is often all too easy to potentially cut the scope of projects to permit delivery timescales yet find out later that key benefits are now unachievable. New benefits should be identified where possible, particularly where previously planned benefits are at risk of being compromised.
Develop benefits tracking and reporting
Manage benefits realisation, conduct regular benefits review to capture progress both in terms of realising those benefits planned for and identification of new ones
Update business case on an ongoing basis
Use a scope management methodology to check benefits if scope changes and provide change control for benefits.

4.  Realising benefits is focused on linking between the final commissioning teams within the Programme, the operational staff who will run the changes processes after handover and the stakeholder groups that will benefit from the new capability. Planning for the realisation of benefits starts early in the programme, and it will be delivered by following a pre-agreed benefit realisation plan for each benefit (or collection of benefits), where project members, operational staff and user stakeholder groups are co-signees of a benefit profile and are jointly accountable for realising a particular benefit. 
Manage and track benefits realisation for actual benefits
Define any required business change approach required to support benefits realisation
Regular benefits management reviews for actual benefits delivery, report progress
Develop capabilities in benefits management (for operational line managers).
